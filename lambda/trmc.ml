open Lambda

(** TRMC (tail-recursion-modulo-cons) is a code transformation that
    rewrites transformed functions in destination-passing-style, in
    such a way that certain calls that were not in tail position in the
    original program become tail-calls in the transformed program.

    As a classic example, the following program
    {|
     let rec map f = function
     | [] -> []
     | x :: xs ->
       let y = f x in
       y :: map f xs
    |}
    becomes (expressed in almost-source-form; the translation is in
    fact at the Lambda-level)
    {|
     let rec map f = function
     | [] -> []
     | x :: xs _>
       let y = f x in
       let dst = y :: Placeholder in
       map_trmc dst 1 f xs; dst
     and map_trmc dst offset f = function
     | [] ->
       dst.1 <- []
     | x :: xs ->
       let y = f x in
       let dst' = y :: Placeholder in
       dst.offset <- dst';
       map_trmc dst offset f fx
    |}

    In this example, the expression (y :: map f xs) had a call in
    non-tail-position, and it gets rewritten into tail-calls.  TRMC
    handles all such cases where the continuation of the call
    (what needs to be done after the return) is a "construction", the
    creation of a (possibly nested) data block.

    The code transformation generates two versions of the
    input function, the "direct" version with the same type and
    behavior as the original one (here just [map]), and
    the "destination-passing-style" version (here just [map_trmc]).

    Any call to the original function from outside the let..rec
    declaration gets transformed into a call into the direct version,
    which will itself call the destination-passing-style versions on
    recursive calls that may benefit from it (they are in tail-position
    modulo constructors).

    Because of this inherent code duplication, the transformation may
    not always improve performance. In this implementation, TRMC is
    opt-in, we only transform functions that the user has annotated
    with an attribute to request the transformation.

    Note: in this implementation, the scope of the TRMC transformation
    is a single set of mutually-recursive-declarations; TRMC applies
    to declarations of the form
      [let[@trmc] rec f1 = t1 and .. and fn = tn in u]
    and only the callsites of [f1..fn] within [t1..tn] will get
    considered for destination-passing-style transformations; callsites in [u]
    are not analyzed, and will always call the direct version (which may
    in turn call the destination-passing-style versions).
    In particular, there is no propagation of information across modules.
*)

type 'offset destination = { var: Ident.t; offset: 'offset; }
and offset = lambda
(** In the OCaml value model, interior pointers are not allowed.  To
    represent the "placeholder to mutate" in DPS code, we thus use a pair
    of the block containing the placeholder, and the offset of the
    placeholder within the block.

    In the common case, this offset is an arbitrary lambda expression, typically
    a constant integer or a variable. We define ['a destination] as parametrized
    over the offset type to represent formal destination parameters (where
    the offset is an Ident.t), and maybe in the future statically-known
    offsets (where the offset is an integer).
*)

let add_dst_params ({var; offset} : Ident.t destination) params =
  (var, Pgenval) :: (offset, Pintval) :: params

let add_dst_args ({var; offset} : offset destination) args =
  Lvar var :: offset :: args

let assign_to_dst loc {var; offset} lam =
  Lprim(Psetfield_computed(Pointer, Heap_initialization),
        [Lvar var; offset; lam], loc)

(** TRMC transformation requires information flows in two opposite
    directions: the information of which callsites can be rewritten in
    destination-passing-style flows from the leaves of the code to the
    root, and the information on whether we remain in tail-position
    flows from the root to the leaves -- and also the knowledge of
    which version of the function we currently want to generate, the
    direct version or a destination-passing-style version.

    To clarify this double flow of information, we split the TRMC
    compilation in two steps:

    1. A function [trmc t] that takes a term and processes it from
    leaves to root; it produces a "code choice", a piece of data of
    type [choice], that contains information on how to transform the
    input term [t] *parameterized* over the (still missing) contextual
    information.

    2. Code-production operators that have contextual information
    to transform a "code choice" into the final code.

    The code-production choices for a single term have type [lambda Choice.t];
    using a parametrized type ['a Choice.t] is useful to represent simultaneous
    choices over several subterms; for example [(lambda * lambda) Choice.t]
    makes a choice for a pair of terms, for example the [then] and [else]
    cases of a conditional (their choice is synchronized, they are either
    both in destination-passing-style or none of them is). With this parameter,
    ['a Choice.t] has an applicative structure, which is useful to write
    the actual code transformation in the {!choice} function.
*)
module Choice = struct
  type 'a t =
    | Return of 'a
    (** [Return t] means that there are no TRMC opportunities in the subterm [t]:
        no matter which context we are in,
        we should evaluate [t] and "return" it. *)
    | Set of 'a settable
    (** [Set t] represents a piece of code that does contain
        TRMC opportunities: if the context allows, we can write parts of
        it in destination-passing-style to turn non-tail calls into tail
        calls. See the type [settable] below. *)

  and 'a settable = {
    dps: offset destination -> 'a;
    direct: unit -> 'a;
  }
  (**
     A [{dps; direct}] record a code that may be written in destination-passing style
     if its usage context allows it. More precisely:

     - If the surrounding context is already in destination-passing
       style, it has a destination available, we should produce the
       code in [dps] -- a function parametrized over the destination.

     - If the surrounding context is in direct style (no destination
       is available), we should produce the fallback code from
       [direct].

      (Note: [direct] is also a function (on [unit]) to ensure that any
      effects performed during code production will only happen once we
      do know that we want to produce the direct-style code.)
